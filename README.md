# Machine Learning OCR Using Python Project 1:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a piece of software that converts printed text and images into digitized form such that it can be manipulated by machine, i.e. image to text .

Two kinds of character recognition:

• Machine Printed- Simple due to uniformity in dimensions, font, etc.

• Handwritten- Complex due to variety of writing styles.

## Importing Essential Libraries:

• pytesseract => optical character recognition (OCR) tool

• cv2 => To solve computer vision problems

## Set Pytesseract Path:

## Read Image:

In python's cv2 library this can be done through imread function.

## Reading Text from Image:

This can be done though pytesseract function image_to_string()

## Future Scope:

Work is constantly being done to improve the accuracy and infer valuable data from images.

Deep learning techniques are being applied along with NLP to achieve far better results.

Convolutional Neural networks along with Recurrent Neural Network have changed the way data was handled. 

Researchers aim to create real time system for image description and incorporate state of the art methods for large-scale category recognition.

Producing human-like and relevant descriptions will be a key factor for enabling accurate and satisfying image retrieval result.
